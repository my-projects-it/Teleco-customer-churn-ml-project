# 📡 Teleco Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning  

## 📌 Overview  
Customer churn (when customers leave a service provider) is a major challenge for teleco companies. This project applies **machine learning** to predict which customers are likely to **cancel their subscription** and helps businesses take preventive actions.  

By analyzing various customer attributes like **tenure, monthly charges, contract type, and support interactions**, this model provides **actionable insights** to reduce churn and improve customer retention.  

## 🎯 Project Goals  
### ✅ **1. Predict Customer Churn**  
Can we accurately identify customers who are likely to leave?  

### ✅ **2. Analyze Key Churn Factors**  
What are the biggest reasons why customers leave?  

### ✅ **3. Improve Retention Strategies**  
How can teleco providers reduce churn and keep customers engaged?  

### ✅ **4. Provide Data-Driven Insights**  
Which customer segments are at the highest risk of churn?

## 🛠️ Machine Learning Techniques Used  
This project employs various **machine learning models**:  

📊 **Supervised Learning:**  
- **Logistic Regression** (Baseline model)  
- **Random Forest & Decision Trees** 🌳
 
🔍 **Feature Engineering & Selection:**  
- Handling **missing values**  
- **Encoding categorical variables**  
- **Scaling numerical features**  

📈 **Model Evaluation Metrics:**  
- **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score** 📊  
- **ROC-AUC Curve** (to assess classifier performance)  

## 🌍 Factors Considered in Predictions  
To improve the accuracy of churn predictions, we analyze:  

### 📊 **Customer Demographics & Account Details**  
- 📅 **Tenure** (How long they’ve been a customer)  
- 📝 **Contract Type** (Monthly, Yearly, Two-Year)  
- 💳 **Payment Method** (Credit Card, Bank Transfer, Online Payment)  

### 📡 **Service Usage & Billing Details**  
- ☎️ **Number of customer support calls**  
- 📶 **Internet Service Type** (Fiber Optic, DSL, No Internet)  
- 💰 **Monthly Charges & Total Charges**  

### 🛑 **Churn Indicators**  
- ❌ Late payments or irregular billing history  
- 🏆 Loyalty (How long they’ve been with the company)  
- 🔄 Change in service plans (frequent upgrades/downgrades)

## 📈 Expected Insights from the Model  
🔹 **Which customers are most likely to churn?** 🛑  
🔹 **Which services contribute most to churn?** (e.g., Fiber Optic users leaving more than DSL users) 📡  
🔹 **How contract type impacts churn rates?** 📝  
🔹 **Which factors are most influential in churn prediction?** (Billing, Customer Support, Internet Service) 📊  
🔹 **Actionable strategies to reduce churn** (e.g., offering discounts to high-risk customers) 💡  

## 🚀 Future Enhancements  
✅ **Sentiment Analysis on Customer Reviews** (to understand dissatisfaction trends) 🗣️  
✅ **Real-time Churn Prediction API** (for integration into business dashboards) 🌐  
✅ **Customer Segmentation using Clustering** (to target retention campaigns more effectively) 🎯  
✅ **Recommendation Engine for Personalized Offers** 🤖  

## 📜 Conclusion  
This project helps teleco providers take a **proactive approach** to customer retention by using **machine learning** to predict churn. By identifying high-risk customers and understanding the key drivers of churn, businesses can design **effective strategies** to improve customer loyalty and reduce revenue loss.
